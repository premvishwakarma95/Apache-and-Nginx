## Apache
Apache (Apache HTTP Server) is one of the most widely used web servers in the world. It is responsible for serving websites and web applications to users over the internet.

### 1 What does Apache do?
Apache listens for HTTP/HTTPS requests from browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and responds with:
- HTML pages
- CSS / JavaScript files
- Images, videos
- API responses (via backend integrations)
In simple words: 👉 Apache delivers your website when someone opens a URL.

### 2 How Apache works (simple flow)
- User enters https://example.com in browser
- Request reaches the server on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)
- Apache:
- - Finds the requested file or route
- - Applies security & configuration rules
- - Sends response back to the browser
